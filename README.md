Project 01 – Build a Movie Application
Course Value: 60%
Due: Jan 14, 2023 (11:59pm)
Instructions:
<!-- 1.)	Create a Movie App as part of a team (max 4 students) or individually using React that meets the following specifications: -->
a.	Contains the following pages (detailed page specifications further down)
<!-- i.	Home Page -->
<!-- ii.	About Page -->
iii.	Individual Movie Page
iv.	My Favourites Page
2.)	For this project, the web application does not (yet) need to be mobile responsive.  Ultimately, if you want to use this in your portfolio, you will want it to be fully responsive, but we will revisit this during the Front-End Web Development 2 module.
3.)	Be well styled, with a usable user interface that follows basic design best practices:
a.	Text content is readable
b.	Elements are in alignment
c.	Good spacing between elements
d.	Application navigation that is present on all the application’s pages 
4.)	Use The Movie DB API to get your movie data for use in this application
a.	Details on how to setup an account and get your API key are shown further down
5.)	The application should use the browser’s local storage to store the users favourited movies which will be used on the “My Favourites” page
6.)	Build your project using the Create React App build script and upload it to your portfolio server and submit a link to your application on the Learning Hub 
a.	Detailed instructions on how to properly upload your application to your portfolio server will be provided during the course
7.)	Upload your raw development files to the Learning Hub. 
a.	Name your project folder using this format:
i.	[student names…]-movie-app
ii.	For example: if your group was Larry, Curly and Moe, your folder name would be: 
1.	larry-curly-moe-movie-app
b.	Please do NOT upload the node_modules folder. This folder is large and is not needed for marking.  A 10% penalty will apply if node_modules are included in the final submission.

FAQ
Q: Can I work in a team?
A: Yes, you can work in a team of up to 4 students, but this is optional.  You can work solo if you wish.
Q: Can I use Bootstrap or another UI framework for styling and layout?
A: Yes, but I would recommend trying to make your application a showcase portfolio piece by giving it a good dose of custom styling.
